First project in Vue 3 using Typescript, Quasar and Axios.

Hosted on Github pages: https://adjoawadee.github.io/

Having to work with Vue 3 for the first time, I've created a TV Show web application that is still work in progress.
I realized, not being familiar with a lot of the concepts of Vue, can be time consuming but I can only learn with trial and error.

A couple of things to note:
- As a result of prioritizing tasks related to this project, setting up the basics and iterating from there while fully learning and understanding concepts rather than blindly implementing features was really important to me. This resulted in an incomplete project not checking off all the requirements.

Points of improvements
- Unit tests
- Better routing
- Lazy loading
- Performance
- Search
- Nuclear Components
